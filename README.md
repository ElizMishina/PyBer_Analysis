# PyBer_Analysisverview of the analysis:

## Overview of the analysis:
### The purpose of the new analysis is well defined.
The purpose of this analysis is to see the total weekly fares for each city type, rural, suburban, urban. We did this by caluclating the average fare per icty and putting it into a graph form.
 
## Results:
### There is a description of the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types. Ride-sharing data include the total rides, total drivers, total fares, average fare per ride and driver, and total fare by city type. 
There are diffrence in the RIde-SHaring data as shown in [Fig1](https://github.com/ElizMishina/PyBer_Analysis/blob/master/analysis/Ride_Sharing_data.png):
* There are far fewer rides in Rural cities as in comparision to Urban cities
* this corrilation also apears in Total Drivers and Total Fares.
* in Average Fare per Ride and Average Fare per Driver the Rural areas have a higher average then the Urban Areas

these results are also as shown in [PyBer_fare_summary](https://github.com/ElizMishina/PyBer_Analysis/blob/master/analysis/PyBer_fare_summary.png).


## Summary:
### There is a statement summarizing three business recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types.
Not much can be done about the depsrities in the diffrent city types, as this is more of a supply and demand issue as well as a distance issue.
* To decrease the diffrences in the average fare per ride or per driver the prices in rural areas can be decresed or the prices in urban areas can be increased.
    * doing this will also have an effect on supply and demand decreasing the total rides in urban areas but increasing them in rural areas
* To decrease the diffrences in the Total fares price in rural areas can be raised and price in urban areas can be decrease
* Also the number of drivers can be changed as will by decreasing the number of drivers in urban areas the supply would be less but the demand still the same giving us the ability to raise the price.
